With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center.\n\nData Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year on year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue.\n\nTraining and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud providers' investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time-to-train models, the lowest cost to train models, and the lowest cost to inference large language models.\n\nFor public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.ai, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, XAi, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter.

Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs.\n\nTheir use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. NVIDIA Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical.\n\nA big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kick-started a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute.\n\nIn our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out.\n\nIn Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models.\n\nSome are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer.\n\nIn Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Centre is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jump-start their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year.\n\nThe importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.\n\nFrom a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture.

We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.\n\nFrom a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2.\n\nThe first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years.\n\nWith ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 grew, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year.\n\nDemand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe; Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the U.K.; and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Centre in Germany.\n\nWe are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the No. 1, the No. 2, and the No.\n\n3 spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2.\n\nIn the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI.\n\nWe expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper.\n\nThe Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion-parameter scale AI.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7651, "end_char_idx": 12160, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9049c2e-1113-4460-bd64-54f6b56b196a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9049c2e-1113-4460-bd64-54f6b56b196a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce8623ce-2ac3-4deb-ae81-b2aba348e292", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "fca0529329a3392557deba88795ae3be9d4c311b3265f29045d6bfb1c2e519e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "737c53b4-bc63-4ac1-b7c1-50e068d21e27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "b5a39492c76ccef4c9fe4ea29425638840bfa8a5004b9ef9c2a726f40b554f55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "482fd938-bfb8-4e7f-b002-73a68711e05f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8f56e163dfef797f8b9d0bdf027156b0847dcd3d86d8e58168c26cb02081116", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster.

This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads, and data center environments in the first-year shipments.\n\nBlackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and XAi. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices, or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton and PrintServer, and TensorRT-LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics, and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock, and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake, and Stability AI.\n\nNIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year on year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range.\n\nFrom the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor cores. Now, with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts, and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT-LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n\nYesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent, and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and non-playable characters. Moving to ProViz, revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year on year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth.\n\nAt GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DXCITE, Dassault Systems brand, and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year.\n\nCompanies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations.

Moving to automotive.\n\nRevenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year on year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI Cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets.\n\nWe also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper, and Nuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets.\n\nAs noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10 as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis.\n\nWe are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full-year opex is expected to grow in the low 40% range.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments.GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun.\n\nCompanies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power.\n\nThe tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video, and 3D and learn to reason and plan.\n\nOur inference workloads are growing incredibly.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15090, "end_char_idx": 19700, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2758d73c-67a3-4ad5-a671-05f6eb568e18": {"__data__": {"id_": "2758d73c-67a3-4ad5-a671-05f6eb568e18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce8623ce-2ac3-4deb-ae81-b2aba348e292", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "fca0529329a3392557deba88795ae3be9d4c311b3265f29045d6bfb1c2e519e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "482fd938-bfb8-4e7f-b002-73a68711e05f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "cb93bbf76e6a486c0ed5e180627679f5efe36345cef7fb4451874822e64591a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bfb026c-9547-4996-87af-c1450ebf7b73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6aa4574b59e90eba176a4c83a2178cf77d9da66cc573feeeefcff8442a22dfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The next industrial revolution has begun.\n\nCompanies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence.

Strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video, and 3D and learn to reason and plan.\n\nOur inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full-stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing.\n\nAI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan, and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general-purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills and, at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\n\nThe Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects, and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere from the cloud to on-prem data centers, to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.\n\nFrom Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.\n\nSimona Jankowski -- Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- it doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore.\n\nWhat does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nWe will be shipping -- well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nGot it. So, this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nWe will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just given the system's nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center.

So, do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYep. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air-cooled, liquid-cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X, and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC -- that I showed at GTC.\n\nAnd so, for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so, Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell.\n\nWe also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain; beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull ahead or a holding behavior because of tight supply, competition, or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nWell, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now, it's going to be multi-modality, Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there.\n\nThere's also a long line of generative AI start-ups, some 15,000, 20,000 start-ups that are in all different fields, from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application, productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars, the list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand those up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data, to train their regional models.\n\nAnd there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So, anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. That's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work.\n\nAnd this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past.

And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven-only computer.\n\nIt's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do. And it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan, and come back with a solution. And so, every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers.\n\nAnd so, that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the start-ups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJoe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. Understanding what you just said about how strong demand is, you have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nWe see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys.\n\nTo what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing mostly internal workloads, or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYeah. We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation.\n\nIt's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so, the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT-LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three.\n\nThat kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So, one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26284, "end_char_idx": 30769, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "780e0c66-6f7f-415f-9014-fd2c39da6184": {"__data__": {"id_": "780e0c66-6f7f-415f-9014-fd2c39da6184", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ce8623ce-2ac3-4deb-ae81-b2aba348e292", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "fca0529329a3392557deba88795ae3be9d4c311b3265f29045d6bfb1c2e519e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba5db165-b104-4459-96f2-ca2be024c8a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q1_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q1_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 51092, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "8c77dc376e911ef4952456011108357240855afc23b3001b8f52bd0336a663e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6e403cc-4afd-4aff-a99a-a8e0e06f22de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e0f883d4415a67e44417c6fa1cfce14782d6ea5bcd2ee9777c3a6d22b2ab7b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference.

So, one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So, accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing.\n\nAnd so, the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data centers. Second, we're in every cloud. And so, for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem.\n\nWe're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so, that's the second reason.\n\nThe third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem.\n\nIt's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so, the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective, in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value to you is $5 billion.\n\nAll the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so, the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters in everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money.\n\nAnd it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so, the highest performance is also the lowest TCO.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training, some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference.\n\nAnd it's an amazing thing to watch but it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on is going to be not as competitive with your new stuff very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So, I'd like you to, if you wouldn't mind, speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, they're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path.\n\nThank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYeah, really appreciate it.

And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path.\n\nThank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYeah, really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build-out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can.\n\nAnd when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, OK? And so, there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance-average your way into it.\n\nSo, that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them.\n\nLet me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable, and getting this thing called time-to-train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so, the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important.\n\nAnd you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership that want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so, leadership matters a great deal. Time-to-train matters a great deal. The difference between time-to-train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time-to-train on three months' project, getting started three months earlier is everything.\n\nAnd so, it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so, that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly, because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything.\n\nWe know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides to look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale.\n\nAnd the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now, one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here but then we disaggregate it and integrate it into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform, and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance.\n\nThis deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so, we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation.\n\nSo, I appreciate it.

Those are the three points.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Lipacis -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down.\n\nAnd this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So, the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so, then the question is, does the general-purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general-purpose framework? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYeah. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general purpose. Like, for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing.\n\nAnd so, the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose computing, not for accelerated computing. And so, I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities, maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded.\n\n5% of the code represents 99% of the run time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now, and now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context.\n\nAll of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so, each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model but to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software: that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily 1 million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it, and we're ready for it.\n\nAnd so, the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies.

And so, those matters are true.\n\nHowever, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there, and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell toward the end of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nSrini Pajjuri -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small.\n\nSo, I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO, or is it something else? Or is it just the architecture? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nYeah. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense, and we integrate it into computer makers.\n\nWe have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even.\n\nAnd so, you're going to see liquid-cooled version, air-cooled version, x86 versions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed.\n\nNow, of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously, the integration of CPUs, and the much more compressed density of computing. Liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so, it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center.\n\nAnd everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking -- of course, NICs. We have Ethernet now so that we can bring AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so, Blackwell is much more expansive.\n\nWe have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities.

Please go ahead.\n\nWilliam Stein -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there were reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth to bring to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper or Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side whereby, while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nWell, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected.\n\nThe interconnect between the two chips -- calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like at terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR.\n\nIt's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so, we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so, you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain.\n\nThat's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so, we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so, there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so, if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it.\n\nAnd today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so, it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking.\n\nAnd amid rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation? And your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive, CUDA, precision, Grace, Cohere, and connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nWell, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And you can also count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet.\n\nBut we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners.

Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market.\n\nAnd so, for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet to network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric.\n\nAnd we're committed, fully committed, to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain, to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so, we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so, you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming.\n\nAnd all of it -- the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So, if you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers, and everything just runs.\n\nAnd so, I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so, we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens, and we're going to do that at scale.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year on year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with Data Center.\n\nData Center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year on year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5x. Networking revenue grew more than 2x from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% of our Data Center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer Internet and enterprise companies.\n\nCustomers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our Data Center growth include generative AI model training and inferencing; video, image, and text data pre and post processing with CUDA and AI workloads; synthetic data generation; AI-powered recommender systems; SQL and Vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue.\n\nOver the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our Data Center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and start-ups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud.\n\nCSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand.

NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and a significant contributor to our Data Center revenue.\n\nAs a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell platform combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA, with the top computer manufacturers, unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers.\n\nWith the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, and Link Switch and the networking chips, systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30x faster inference for LLM's workloads and unlocking the ability to run trillion-parameter models in real time. Hopper demand is strong, and Blackwell is widely sampling.\n\nWe executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.\n\nHopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings.\n\nSpectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprises, including xAI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6x the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of DPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on track to begin a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\n\nOur sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started.\n\nEnterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter.

Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multibillion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Health care is also on its way to being a multibillion-dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery.\n\nDuring the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1 collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications.\n\nNVIDIA NIMs accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowes, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and eight times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem.\n\nWe announced NIM Agent Blueprint, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM Agent Blueprint, enterprises can refine their AI applications over time, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM Agent Blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to enterprises.\n\nNVIDIA NIM and NIM Agent Blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS, and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PC. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year on year.\n\nWe saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue, and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designed from leading PC manufacturers.

Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year on year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads.\n\nAutomotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz, signed multiyear contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins of factories.\n\nWe announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workloads, accelerating our ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing the USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as The Coca-Cola Company. Moving to automotive and robotics. Revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year on year.\n\nYear-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramp in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving upscale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Boston Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsyc, Siemens, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L.\n\nGAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion toward shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per shareholder.\n\nOur board of directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products.\n\nWe expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our Data Center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid- to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.\n\nFurther financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.

[Operator instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And as a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\n\nYour line is open.\n\nVivek Arya -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there's a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back-end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing, what that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary.\n\nAnd so, we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell, Grace Blackwell, and a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex, and we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customers' customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of capex going forward.\n\nInternally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts capex? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook and how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out, I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production but shipping up. On the longer-term question, let's take a step back. And you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time.\n\nThe first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time and it has slowed to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year.\n\nAnd so, if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so, the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications.\n\nIt also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed.

And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost.\n\nAnd the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multitrillion-parameter models and train it on -- pretrain it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so which caused the generative AI revolution. Now, generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just the capability.\n\nIt's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers. What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function.\n\nIt learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so, you could learn the function of almost anything. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so, now here we are with generative AI.\n\nIt's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms, and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So, the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale.\n\nAnd they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the data set to go train it. And so, the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so, it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation.\n\nSo, we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. And so, the first one is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. And surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so, you have more and more and more.\n\nThat's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT image generators. We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now.\n\nWe, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems, largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs.

Of course, the number of generative AI start-ups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. And sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting, and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises.\n\nThe companies that we're talking to, so many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of the company. And then general robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse, we are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about, start building general robotics. And so, you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going.\n\nAnd so, we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nAnd Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So, more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So, yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoe Moore -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible. But it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong.\n\nI mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So, how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. And it's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible.\n\nThere's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane.\n\nIt's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. But almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Panda's data, data science toolkits like Panda's, and the new one, Polar's.\n\nThese are the ones -- the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so, number one is the primary -- the No.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22712, "end_char_idx": 27344, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "603348f0-de7e-4ba1-a69c-27e76aa56d9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "603348f0-de7e-4ba1-a69c-27e76aa56d9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q2_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q2_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 53535, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e757f2cf-4da1-4dc9-95dd-11f5f55849dc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q2_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q2_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 53535, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "0cb073c6fab078300631b55ed0211b086912ac2ceecfc5f7e3c79a5b506ec836", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "10d9cbee-a2fb-4f3c-8f6d-8121a1c748a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q2_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q2_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 53535, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "1b69c7480fe83b37a8f53b311a997c2532c58a5cf5990f91ba8d119cfba7eae8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95d12f95-97bf-4994-a0c2-2904b62dc7fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa7f6b7decea71a206a6239c10000e4a6bc3d901da1dc6a68948181ccb0191ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example.

And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so, number one is the primary -- the No. 1 use case long before generative AI came along is that the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing.\n\nThe second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers. They're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products.\n\nAnd so, these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money. They want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do.\n\nYou can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so, there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to be -- get to introduce a revolutionary level of AI.\n\nThe second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so, the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that, and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace.\n\nWe want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future and the benefits that we can bring to society, we want to see all that come true. And so, these model makers are the same.\n\nOf course, they want to be the world's best. They want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so, between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic.\n\nAnd so, everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper.\n\nOf course, H200 is state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so, I think people are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure and Hopper's state-of-the-art.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Ramsay -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Jensen, I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about the ROI on all of this capex. And hopefully, this question and the distinction will make some sense.\n\nBut what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier toward AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability, and they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on capex versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense.

Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so, one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles.\n\nYou have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money.\n\nThat's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI.\n\nAnd so, your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it.\n\nBut at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA.\n\nThat's the best way to do it.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth, both near and longer term. I know Colette, you did increase opex for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish.\n\nOn the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling, and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim.

I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So, remember, the world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers.\n\n$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear: because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation.\n\nSecond, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we could all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so, I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next $1 trillion of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last $1 trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta.\n\nAnd I think it was Volta. And so, we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled.\n\nHowever, the number of data centers that want to go to liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can, in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power-limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from three to five times the AI throughput compared to the past. And so, liquid cooling is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink, which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs.\n\nAnd so, imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink. And that, we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput large language model inference, and the large NVLink domain is going to be a game changer for that. And so, I think people are very comfortable deploying both.\n\nAnd so, almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so, I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our Data Center business quite significantly next year.\n\nBlackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time. And that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing, and human-engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence-learned software.\n\nOK.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have two short questions for Colette. The first several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4, is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half.\n\nDoes that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins. If I have mid-70s for the year, let's say, where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range.

And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nSo, Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So, we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So, let's say, Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that.\n\nAdditionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting ramping in Q4. So, I hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3.\n\nWe provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75 in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75. So, we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4, again with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions.\n\nHowever, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out, and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially.\n\nJust wondering what the dynamics are there. And obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks. What are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter, given all those favorable revenue dynamics.\n\nThanks.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nLet me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure in a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. The pieces in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to, and so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may even travel to the end customer.\n\nThese are just moving to our OEMs or ODMs and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So, what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there are invoicing to China.\n\nKeep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also Data Center, also automotive in those numbers that we have.

We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that that will be a growth opportunity in Q4.\n\nOn top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more, given rising complexity in a rather limit advanced package world.\n\nSo, curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships, and then taking through a consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to continue to drive its cost down.\n\nIt's growing so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models, that we'll reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so, we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale.\n\nWe have the ability, fairly uniquely, to integrate, to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless you have all the parts. And so, we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX for East and West, BlueField DPUs for North and South, and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so, the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this, we have one architectural stack, as you know, it allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it.\n\nOtherwise, what happens, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to, and then you've got to build -- somebody's got to build up an AI factory, and the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so, it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro. We used to be able to serve ZTE.\n\nThey were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so, the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers, the scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrators, integrated supply chain, is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so, that part, we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41041, "end_char_idx": 45467, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b04af4c-e96e-416a-a756-c4e90401f0e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b04af4c-e96e-416a-a756-c4e90401f0e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q2_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q2_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 53535, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e757f2cf-4da1-4dc9-95dd-11f5f55849dc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q2_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q2_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 53535, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "0cb073c6fab078300631b55ed0211b086912ac2ceecfc5f7e3c79a5b506ec836", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aef9dd88-eb29-4d71-8fc6-ebd4028c6e7c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q2_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q2_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 53535, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "40f274bfd79df0781f60b40ce38ece46462d745a5c9177b957fffa202d30241a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7adf9ba0-2773-43f0-b144-ef6ef32488ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab3498ae2da932c89eb6ed5b20a201f7f6511887f9e94d8c8bc5a9cf6f13d827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro.

So, anyways, that's the reason why.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about GB NVL72 and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle.\n\nI guess to put it simply, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because everybody's rack's a little different surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different.\n\nChoice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so, the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components.\n\nLike for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant.\n\nAnd so, just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to. It has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so, you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners.\n\nAnd so, I think because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration.\n\nThat's their value-add. There's a final design-in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center but the design fit-in is really complicated. And so, the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world.\n\nAnd we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So, integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator, we want to be a technology provider.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.

Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. The data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\n\nLet me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible.\n\nAccelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA-X Accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, CUVI-S for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now.\n\nAriel and for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one.\n\nNumber two, Blackwall is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just the GPU. Also happens to be the name of our GPU but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear.\n\nThe Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize, the Gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a colos package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-size computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform, full stack end to end, from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounds of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures.\n\nCustomers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing.\n\nThe Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10x higher than Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multitrillion-parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so, that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU.\n\nFor inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput large language model token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating.\n\nGenerative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast but it's just the tip of the iceberg.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year on year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion.\n\nAll market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with data center. Another record was achieved in data center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year on year.\n\nNVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2x year on year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of DPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads.\n\nNVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure, with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped year on year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year on year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models training, multimodal, and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers.\n\nNVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5x in one year and cut time to first token by 5x.

Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance by an additional 2.4x.\n\nContinuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full-stack, full-infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLink.\n\nAnd from liquid-cooled to air-cooled, every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us.\n\nCustomers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in private preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200 and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper.\n\nThe results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4x reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput, and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created.\n\nHundreds of AI-native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Though Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners, Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Light Tricks, Harvey, Podium, Purser, and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of AI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle.\n\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIMs micro services is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Copilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises.\n\nAccenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture, with over 707,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA-powered agentic AI applications internally, including one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns for 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full-year revenue to increase over 2x from last year, and our pipeline continues to build.\n\nOverall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3753, "end_char_idx": 8478, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1eb73613-cb4f-44e3-a46f-243778b70d33": {"__data__": {"id_": "1eb73613-cb4f-44e3-a46f-243778b70d33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66e9e9a3-fff5-41e6-bdc7-2de0a6540a30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "5e3ff691e6fd1d5944ffb08ac066305be2f291c44d0693ed3401ea6b0bb78b63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "97c573f7-3833-4035-92eb-d761758756b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "afc51529feec98431e09cdc0a5d9b3ae9cbaf150d560bb715026c901ce23d57d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04e5cb3d-b5fe-4e10-8f56-19468eaa5f88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84b646b8462c00a6637f80d4ca0b50a12e3e20c64eb743074dde83ec551f2459", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises.\n\nAccenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out.

Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics.\n\nSome of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twin and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its Blackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to industries.\n\nAs a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI.\n\nIndia's leading CSPs include product communications and data services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TFC, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand.\n\nSoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and ARN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S. with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC, and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise, and major consulting companies, including EY Strategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries.\n\nNetworking revenue increased 20% year on year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters.\n\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3x year on year. And our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their compute.\n\nUtilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus 100,000-Hopper supercomputer experienced zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% of data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now, moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year on year.

These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation, and coding.\n\nThis past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the AI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz.\n\nRevenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year on year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive.\n\nRevenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year on year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Global Cars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L.\n\nGAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within data center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nTotal revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth-quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.\n\nBlackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with seven different types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s. When fully ramp, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.

Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nYour line is open.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled.\n\nObviously, we're very early here, but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So, is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOur foundation model pretraining scaling is intact, and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough, that we've now discovered two other ways to scale.\n\nOne is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback, and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what is called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.\n\nAnd it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question. And so, we now have three ways of scaling, and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great.\n\nYou see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so, that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons.\n\nBut remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15118, "end_char_idx": 19652, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9be63b6-1373-47c4-a398-5ea548e909cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9be63b6-1373-47c4-a398-5ea548e909cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66e9e9a3-fff5-41e6-bdc7-2de0a6540a30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "5e3ff691e6fd1d5944ffb08ac066305be2f291c44d0693ed3401ea6b0bb78b63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad39513a-b1ad-464e-99f9-bab3bc140862", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "1a5a91a7714007c0bed8e0373996ff77e4ab43e37df55ecf88b046cd01e98bdb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6c1bc1d-39a1-460f-9436-74c8d19c8584", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb1aa15db9b16c9e08a120a23671ca444f6d24f1c40233c906b0c0ff120d226e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons.\n\nBut remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company.

Your line is open.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year.\n\nThere were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B.\n\nOn supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this, or is it specifically HBN? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks. So, let's see. Back to the first question.\n\nBlackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply.\n\nAnd that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so, Blackwell demand is very strong.\n\nOur execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up.\n\nYou have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so, all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because, although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer, and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.\n\nAnd as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace.\n\nAnd the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18823, "end_char_idx": 23171, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6c1bc1d-39a1-460f-9436-74c8d19c8584": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6c1bc1d-39a1-460f-9436-74c8d19c8584", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66e9e9a3-fff5-41e6-bdc7-2de0a6540a30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "5e3ff691e6fd1d5944ffb08ac066305be2f291c44d0693ed3401ea6b0bb78b63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9be63b6-1373-47c4-a398-5ea548e909cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/raghavsunil/Documents/Projects/AI Earnings Call App/backend/app/data/transcripts/Q3_2025.txt", "file_name": "Q3_2025.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 50016, "creation_date": "2025-07-13", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-13"}, "hash": "8cd8920d484526932e22081c135a1e0d8fd17d15e808505905821a6455d97014", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cfddfb2-8521-4110-82c4-ff7c93663e3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4e3d0ad20d118673381fab1168879ca7549386bd39d7f37c3d2da3a251193d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.\n\nAnd as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates.

And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain.\n\nAnd we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company; Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron; Spill Amcor; KYEC; and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built; and Quanta and Wiwynn; and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo. And the number of companies is just really quite incredible. Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate.\n\nAnd so, anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform.\n\nBut it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size.\n\nIt could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's -- most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so, on the one hand, our annual road map reduces costs.\n\nBut on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so, that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intention of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Arcuri -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than -- I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that.\n\nBut I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So, I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So, I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So, you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April.\n\nI'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us.

Thanks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nColette, why don't you start?\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nSure. Let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins, as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning, and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first program.\n\nSo, you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nHopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so, that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant.\n\nThe first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so, machine learning is also what enables generative AI.\n\nAnd so, on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something.\n\nJust like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is.\n\nIt's unlike a data center of the past. And so, these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so, we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities.

Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nOK. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes.\n\nBut yes, it is definitely possible.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if you just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's capex -- if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have plenty of old data centers.\n\nAnd so, what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. But let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning.\n\nThat's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything.\n\nIt's something that's completely brand new. It's, in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so, we're going to see more and more companies like that.\n\nAnd they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey, digital marketing intelligence like Rider's, so on and so forth.\n\nAnd the number of these companies, these -- what are they called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every platform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall. There were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies.\n\nNow, they're AI natives. And so, these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.

And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up several billion dollars.\n\nBut it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nSo, first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well.\n\nWe're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year, so we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out.\n\nIt is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell.\n\nSo, we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes. Is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's possible, but we'll just have to see.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJoseph Moore -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling influence projects.\n\nBut you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age, that you could use some of the Hopper chips for inference. So, I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOur hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so, we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7 and that there will be a whole bunch of AI native start-ups, thousands of AI native start-ups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens.\n\nAnd every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens.

One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I used the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it.\n\nAnd so, I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI. Just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world.\n\nAnd it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so, that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about.\n\nAnd it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is -- so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback. Instead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI.\n\nAnd so, that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference, and we're starting to see that growth happening. So, I'm super excited about that. Now, let me just say one more thing.\n\nInference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build.\n\nAnd these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so, the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger.\n\nThey're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work.\n\nAnd if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so, that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nAaron Rakers -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially.\n\nBut then your comments were that you were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CFP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So, I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the Networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about.

Thank you.\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nLet's first start with the networking. The growth year over year is tremendous. And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of that.\n\nOur ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So, this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems we are providing them to.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAtif Malik -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking my question. I have two quick ones for Colette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you mentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply constrained situation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply toward data center?\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\nSo, first, starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and the work that they are doing. So, our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI.\n\nThis is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So, our Gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast.\n\nNow, the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nBen Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth.\n\nSo, very strong sequential growth this quarter, and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply just in the first half, there would be some catch-up. So, I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the U.S.\n\nand the China situation, have you gotten any sense or any conversations about tariffs or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there.

And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that, do the best we can and just as we always do. And so, we have to simultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along fully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and to compete in the marketplace.\n\nWe'll do all of these three things simultaneously.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your line is open.\n\nPierre Ferragu -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and inference as well and then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so, you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and reflection.\n\nAnd so, I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models, and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so, my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training, as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute. And we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution going.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.

The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI.\n\nSecond, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago.\n\nThe computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing.\n\nAI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data.\n\nThe age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us, and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us serve the entire multitrillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead from every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics.\n\nThanks for joining us today, and catch up next time.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator signoff]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 47304, "end_char_idx": 50016, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}}
